# Obsidian Dev Utils [![](https://badge.fury.io/js/obsidian-dev-utils.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/obsidian-dev-utils)

`Obsidian Dev Utils` is a collection of essential functions and CLI tools designed to streamline your Obsidian plugin development process. Whether you're building a plugin from scratch or enhancing an existing one, these utilities are here to simplify your workflow.

## What is Obsidian?

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. It's a tool that lets you take notes and organize them, and it supports a rich plugin ecosystem that allows for extensive customization.

## Who Should Use This Package?

This package is ideal for developers who are building or maintaining plugins for Obsidian. It provides a range of tools to make the development process easier, including automated builds, linting, spellchecking, and more.

## Plugin Generator

There is a [Obsidian Plugin Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/mnaoumov/generator-obsidian-plugin) that sets up a new Obsidian plugin project with a basic structure and some useful scripts from this library.

## Installation

To install the package, run the following command:

```bash
npm install obsidian-dev-utils
```

## Usage

### CLI Commands

The package offers several CLI commands to facilitate common development tasks.

[See details](./docs/cli-commands.md).

### Helper Functions

`Obsidian Dev Utils` also provides a range of general-purpose and Obsidian-specific helper functions.

The functions are grouped by files and folders and you have multiple ways to import them:

```typescript
import { prompt } from 'obsidian-dev-utils/obsidian/Modal/Prompt';
await prompt({ app, title: 'Enter your name' });

import { Prompt } from 'obsidian-dev-utils/obsidian/Modal';
await Prompt.prompt({ app, title: 'Enter your name' });

import { Modal } from 'obsidian-dev-utils/obsidian';
await Modal.Prompt.prompt({ app, title: 'Enter your name' });

import { obsidian } from 'obsidian-dev-utils';
await obsidian.Modal.Prompt.prompt({ app, title: 'Enter your name' });

import * as obsidianDevUtils from 'obsidian-dev-utils';
await obsidianDevUtils.obsidian.Modal.Prompt.prompt({
  app,
  title: 'Enter your name'
});
```

## Styling

The library provides some extensible styles that you can use to style your plugin UI controls.

In order to use those styles in your plugin, the plugin context has to be initialized.

If your plugin class extends `PluginBase` (it should if your project was generated using [generator-obsidian-plugin](https://github.com/mnaoumov/generator-obsidian-plugin)), this is handled automatically.

Otherwise, you need to initialize it manually:

```ts
import {
  initPluginContext
} from 'obsidian-dev-utils/obsidian/Plugin/PluginContext';

class MyPlugin extends Plugin {
  public override onload(): void {
    initPluginContext(this.app, this.manifest.id);
    // ...
  }
}
```

Default styles are defined in [main.scss](https://github.com/mnaoumov/obsidian-dev-utils/blob/main/src/styles/main.scss).

The list of css classes is defined in [CssClass.ts](https://github.com/mnaoumov/obsidian-dev-utils/blob/main/src/CssClass.ts).

You can override those styles in your plugin's `styles.css` file via adding your plugin's id to the selector, e.g. for plugin `foo-bar`:

```css
.foo-bar.obsidian-dev-utils :invalid {
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px var(--text-error);
}
```

## Setting Components

The library provides some setting components that you can use in your plugin.

See all available components in the [Components](https://github.com/mnaoumov/obsidian-dev-utils/tree/main/src/obsidian/Components/SettingComponents) folder.

In order for components to look properly, their styles has to be initialized. See [Styling](#styling) for more details.

Example of all settings components: built-in and custom:

![Components 1](./images/components1.png)

![Components 2](./images/components2.png)

## Modals

The library provides some modals that you can use in your plugin.

See all available modals in the [Modals](https://github.com/mnaoumov/obsidian-dev-utils/tree/main/src/obsidian/Modals) folder.

In order for models to look properly, their styles has to be initialized. See [Styling](#styling) for more details.

Example of all modals:

![Alert](./images/alert.png)

![Confirm](./images/confirm.png)

![Prompt](./images/prompt.png)

![Select Item](./images/select-item.png)

## Debugging

By default, console debug messages are not shown. To enable them you have to enable `Verbose` mode in the console settings.

![Console settings](./images/console-settings.png)

When you enable `Verbose` mode, you will see debug messages in the console sent via `console.debug()` calls.

`obsidian-dev-utils` library uses [debug](https://github.com/debug-js/debug) library to enable conditional logging.

By default, none of the debug messages are shown. You have to enable the debug namespace explicitly.

To see debug messages for your plugin `foo-bar`, you have to enable them by running the corresponding command in the console:

```javascript
window.DEBUG.enable('foo-bar'); // show all debug messages from the `foo-bar` plugin
window.DEBUG.enable('foo-bar:obsidian-dev-utils:*'); // show all debug messages from the `obsidian-dev-utils` library within the `foo-bar` plugin
window.DEBUG.enable('foo-bar:*'); // show all debug messages from the `foo-bar` plugin and its submodules
window.DEBUG.enable('*:obsidian-dev-utils:*'); // show all debug messages for the `obsidian-dev-utils` library within any plugin
window.DEBUG.enable('*'); // show all debug messages
```

See full documentation of [`window.DEBUG`](https://github.com/mnaoumov/obsidian-dev-utils/blob/main/src/DebugController.ts).

> [!NOTE]
>
> You will see `StackTraceFakeError` in the debug messages. They are not actual errors. It's just a workaround to make stack trace links clickable.
>
> Do not add `window.DEBUG` calls in your plugin code. This is designed to be run only from the console.

In order to write your debug messages from your plugin, use:

```js
plugin.consoleDebug('foo', 'bar', 'baz');
```

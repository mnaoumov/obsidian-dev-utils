 * Finds how highly a note ranks in the priority list.
 *
 * An entry matches in one of four ways, picked by its shape so that one list can express all of them:
 *
 * - `property:name` — the note's frontmatter has `name`; `property:name=value` also compares the value.
 * - `/regular expression/` — tested against the note's path.
 * - `.ext` — the note's path ends with it, case-insensitively. This is the form the request asked for.
 * - anything else — a path from the vault root, matching the vocabulary of the include / exclude
 *   path settings.
 *
 * When a note matches several entries the **longest** one decides its rank, so the most specific
 * entry wins and the order of the list is left to express priority. Without this an Excalidraw note
 * could never rank below a plain markdown one: `drawing.excalidraw.md` also ends with `.md`, so
 * `.md` above `.excalidraw.md` — the very example the request is built on — would tie instead of
 * resolving. Equal-length matches fall to the earlier entry.
